/*
Q.3 Create a class called Employee with the below attributes:  -  
employeeld - int  
name - String  
branch - String  
rating - double  
company Transport - boolean  

The above attributes should be private. write getters, setters and parameterized constructor as required.  
Create class MyClass with main method.  
Implement two static methods 
findCountOfEmployeesUsingCompTransport & findEmployeeWithSecondHighestRating  in MyClass class.

--findCountOfEmployeesUsingCompTransport method:  This method will take an array of Employee object and a String parameter as input parameters. 
                                                  This method will calculate and return the count of Employees who are all using company transport in the given branch (String parameter passed). 
                                                  If no Employee in the given branch using company transport in the array of Employee objects, then the method should return 0.  
                                                  
--findEmployeeWithSecondHighestRating method:    This method will take an array of Employee objects as an input parameter.
                                                 This method will return the object of the second highest rating employee from the array of Employee objects who are not using company transport. 
                                                 If all Employees using company transport in the array of Employee objects, then the method should return null.  
                                                 
Note: All the searches should be case sensitive, companyTransport and rating combination of each Employee is unique. 

For findCountOfEmployeesUsingCompTransport method, The main method should print the returned count as it is if the returned value is greater than 0, 
else it should print "No such Employees".  
-Ex: 2, where 2 is the count  

For findEmployeeWithSecondHighestRating method: The main method should print the employeeld and name from the returned object 
if the returned value is not null. If the returned value is null, 
then it should print "All Employees using company transport".  
Ex: 1003
    Uma  
    
where 1003 is the employeeld and Uma is the name.  
Before calling these static methods in main, 
use Scanner object to read the values of four Employee objects referring attributes in the above mentioned attributes sequence. 
Next, read the value of String parameter for capturing branch.

Input:  
1001
Ashwa

5
true
1002
Preeti

4
true
1003
Uma
Admin
3

Output :

1003  
Uma
